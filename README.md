## Setup Instructions

1. Import the provided `.json` file into your n8n environment.
2. Connect your Google Sheets account as a credential.
3. Connect your SMTP email account for sending emails.
4. Open the workflow and trigger it manually.
5. Make sure your Google Sheet includes the following columns:  
   `first_name`, `company`, `last_product_purchased`, `renewal_date`, `email`, `email_status`, `last_contacted`
6. The workflow will send personalized emails and update the sheet accordingly.
